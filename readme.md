techbookclub's official site
===================

**The beginning of an online archive of the techbookclub collective.**

Initially, a browsable archive of the material pursued by the San Francisco and New York City contingents.

The future:

- Details about the collective's beginning
- Information on how to join the club
- Accounts for members to allow for:
  - A voting system to elect new material
  - Private downloads of copyrighted material
- An Amazon affiliates account to append to public links to bring in funds for snacks/drinks at meetings
