So, we have a podcast now. It's called The Internet Programme, and we spell it both the British and American way, depending on the character limit of the service we're using.

‘The Process’ is our pilot episode, and it's too long. Sorry about that. But we very much enjoyed recording it, and hopefully you'll find our conversation—about slow publishing on the internet, lots of cultural differences of Britain and America, British radio pioneer and hero John Peel, and our Twitter follower's suggestions of what to name the show—at least somewhat interesting and entertaining. Also, Ben explains Gas Marks to Bill, and Bill explains why American radio stations are all known by alphabetic abbreviations to Ben.
